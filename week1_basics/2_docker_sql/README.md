# Docker

Docker is a containerization technique to isolate and ensure consistency in development environments.

## Dockerfile

A Dockerfile is used to build a Docker image, which is then used to run a container. A Docker image is the base from which a container runs.

## Docker Compose
a docker-compose.yaml file is especially useful when running multiple containers that are working together. These will be working together in the same docker docker network. The network is created automatically.

## Data Ingestion
the ingest_data.py script is uploading data in csv files into the Postgresql database.
