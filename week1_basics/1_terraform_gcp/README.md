# Terraform + GCP

I will make use of Terraform to deploy infrastructure into GCP.

## Terraform

Terraform is an Infrastructure as Code (IaC) tool.
It is used to automate provisioning of Infrasture. In this project I will use it to provision GCP infrastructure.

## GCP

Google Cloud Platform is a cloud infrastructure platform. I will be utilising Google Cloud Storage (GCS), and Google BigQuery for this project.
