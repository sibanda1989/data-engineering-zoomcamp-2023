# Data Engineering Zoomcamp Project

In this capstone project, I will showcase my data engineering skills in the following areas:

- Cloud
- Infrastructure as Code
- Workflow Orchestration
- Data Warehouse
- Batch Processing

I will apply these skills in developing an end to end data pipeline.


## Dataset
I will use the [Open Rail Data](https://wiki.openraildata.com/index.php/Rail_Data_FAQ) for Uk train trips.
